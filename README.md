The latest outbreak of monkeypox has become a serious concern for healthcare professionals worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for early and accurate diagnosis to curb its rapid progression. To address this challenge, we have developed a new Hybrid Monkeypox Skin Dataset (HMSD) skin image-based dataset for the detection of monkeypox disease, which comprises two classes: Monkeypox and Other. 

Our Raw data 1428 Monkey Pox and 1764 NonMonkey  and CGAN Augmented data has 4000 Monkey Pox and 4000 NonMonkey Pox Images. All images were collected from reputable internet-based health websites, and the dataset has been compiled by Md Abbas Mahmud Suzon, Md Shofiqul Islam, and Md Habibur Rahman, with contributions from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Islamic University, Kushtia 7003, Bangladesh, and the Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation (IISRI), Deakin University, Geelong, Australia.
